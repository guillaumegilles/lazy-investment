# Lazy Investments

Lazy investment is a Machine Learning project to help investment decision making based on firms‚Äô publications. This project is influenced by a paper published in 2019 by three americans researchers, Lauren Cohen, Christopher Malloy and Quoc Nguyen. They introduced the idea that when firms make an active change in their reporting practices, this conveys an important signal about future firm operations. Changes to the language and construction of financial reports also have strong implications for firms‚Äô future returns.
