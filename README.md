# Lazy Investments

Lazy investment is a *Machine Learning project* influenced by a paper published in 2019 by three American researchers, Lauren Cohen, Christopher J. Malloy, and Quoc Nguyen. They show that when firms make an active change in their reporting practices, this conveys an important signal about future firm operations. Changes to the language and construction of financial reports also have strong implications for firms‚Äô future returns. Changes in language referring to the executive (CEO and CFO) team, regarding litigation, or in the risk factor section of the documents are especially informative for future returns.

Based on these researches, this Machine Learning project is designed to:

1. Collect firms' financial reports;
2. Process and clean data to generate CSV files;
3. Train Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to predict investment opportunities.

**Through a web-based interface, Lazy Investissement is a tool designed to help investors to make better financial decisions.**
